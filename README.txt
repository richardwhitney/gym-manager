Statement:
I aimed to implement everything up to and including the outstanding level of the assignment

Extra features:
Used some java 8 stream syntax - ie in the editAssessment method of MenuController

Known bugs/problems:
The user is asked to enter the date of an assessment as a String.
I'd imagine if the user entered an incorrect format (eg "dklfadsjla") this would cause a crash
in the application when sorting the dates
